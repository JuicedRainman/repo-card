# repo-card

Welcome to repo-card! This project helps you showcase your GitHub repositories on your website in a visually appealing and easy-to-use manner. It's a simple web application that fetches repository data from GitHub and displays it as attractive display cards.

## What It Does

With GitHub Repo Card, you can:
- Display your repository name, description, programming language, stars, forks, and source (if forked).
- Automatically fetch colors associated with programming languages from a JSON file.
- Enjoy a responsive design that looks great on any device.

## How to Use

- **Customize Repository Display**: You can customize which repositories to display by editing the `index.html` file. Just modify the `data-repo` attribute of the `<div class="repo-card">` element with your desired repository name.
- **Personalize Appearance**: Want to change the look? Feel free to tweak the CSS styles in the `<style>` tag within the HTML file.
- **Extend Functionality**: If you're feeling adventurous, you can dive into the JavaScript code and add more features or tailor the behavior to your liking.
